üìñ Mathematical Frameworks
üéÆ GANs: Game Theory Framework
GANs implement a two-player zero-sum game between Generator (G) and Discriminator (D):
Objective: min_G max_D V(G,D) = E[log D(x)] + E[log(1-D(G(z)))]
Key Properties:

Nash Equilibrium: Solution where neither player can improve unilaterally
Training Dynamics: Alternating gradient updates seeking equilibrium
Challenges: Non-convex optimization, mode collapse, training instability

üåä Diffusion Models: Stochastic Process Framework
Diffusion models learn to reverse a gradual noise addition process:
Forward Process:  q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = N(x_t; ‚àö(1-Œ≤_t)x_{t-1}, Œ≤_t I)
Reverse Process:  p_Œ∏(x_{t-1}|x_t) = N(x_{t-1}; Œº_Œ∏(x_t,t), œÉ_t I)
Training Objective: E[||Œµ - Œµ_Œ∏(x_t, t)||¬≤]
Key Properties:

Markov Process: Each step depends only on the previous state
Ergodicity: Process eventually reaches stationary distribution N(0,I)
Score Matching: Learn gradient of log probability density
Stability: Single objective optimization with theoretical guarantees

üéØ Key Insights

Different Mathematical Paradigms: GANs frame generation as a competitive game, while diffusion models treat it as learning to reverse a natural process.
Trade-offs: GANs offer speed but suffer from training instability. Diffusion models provide stability and quality at the cost of computational efficiency.
Practical Implications: Choose GANs for real-time applications, diffusion models for high-quality content generation.

The repository includes several experiments demonstrating key concepts:

Training Stability Comparison: Visual analysis of loss curves and convergence patterns
